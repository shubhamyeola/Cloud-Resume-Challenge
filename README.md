# The-Cloud-Resume-Challenge
Here I will challenge myself to complete this [challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/).

* Cloud Resume Challenge 

- day1 - I have already deployed a static website on S3 using cloudfront,Route53 & Ceriticate Manager and of course S3. So on day1 I have just replaced previous react app with resume in html.
- day2 - Added some CSS, I already wasted more time on CSS than intended, I'll work on CSS later. 
- day3 - Hosted a website on github also and tried to sync it with S3 so whenever I push changes to git it should reflect in S3 also, used github actions but getting some error.
